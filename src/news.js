        title: "Reaper triumphant. Wins Battle for the briefcase !!!!!",
        body: "Last night in Zanesville Oh, the main event match was a 15 man Battle Royal. What was the prize? A briefcase suspended above the ring. What's so special about a briefcase? This particular briefcase contained a guaranteed match for any title at any time. Four men would start the match with a new competitor entering the ring every thirty seconds. After thirteen men were eliminated the battle for the briefcase would begin. In the end, two men stood in the ring (two of the original four) TWISTED and Cody Reaper. After a short stare-down (that expressed their respect for each other) and a nod (that said let's finish this) the two men tore into each other. With every ounce of energy they had left, they tried to finish the other. But this night belonged to Reaper. The big question is when will he cash in?"
